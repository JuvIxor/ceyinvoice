# CeyInvoice: Technical Overview

## Architecture

CeyInvoice is built using a modern React frontend architecture following atomic design principles, which organizes components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

### Component Structure

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, and simple UI elements
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms that form more complex UI components
- **Organisms**: Larger, more complex components composed of molecules and atoms
- **Templates**: Page layouts without specific content
- **Pages**: Complete views with content

### Key Technologies

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **React Router**: For client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling components
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server

## Core Features

### Invoice Creation

The invoice creator studio allows users to:
- Select from multiple templates
- Add company and client details
- Add line items with descriptions, quantities, and prices
- Add terms and conditions
- Customize colors and fonts
- Preview the invoice in real-time

### Invoice Management

Users can:
- Save invoices for future reference
- Edit existing invoices
- Organize invoices by client or date

### Export Options

Invoices can be exported as:
- PDF documents
- CSV files
- Image files (PNG/JPEG)

## Data Flow

1. User inputs are captured in the creator studio
2. Data is processed and formatted for the selected template
3. The preview is generated in real-time
4. Upon saving or exporting, the data is processed into the requested format

## Future Enhancements

- **Cloud Sync**: Sync invoices across devices
- **Advanced AI Features**: Automated data extraction from receipts or purchase orders
- **Invoice Tracking**: Track payment status and send reminders
- **Recurring Invoices**: Set up automatically generated invoices on a schedule
- **Multi-language Support**: Support for creating invoices in different languages

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of components to reduce initial load time
- Optimized image assets
- Efficient state management to minimize rerenders

## Security

- Client-side only application with no server-side processing of sensitive data
- No storage of financial data on remote servers
